## Introduction

This library provides a data type (LFE record) for complex numbers as well as
many mathematical operations which support the complex data type. For a full
list of functions in the API, see the bottom of this README file.


## Installation

Just add it to your ``rebar.config`` deps:

```erlang
  {deps, [
    ...
    {complex, ".*",
      {git, "git@github.com:YOURNAME/complex.git", "master"}}
      ]}.
```

And then do the usual:

```bash
    $ rebar get-deps
    $ rebar compile
```
